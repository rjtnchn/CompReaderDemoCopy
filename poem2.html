          <ul>
            <li>An ant on the tablecloth</li>
            <li>Ran into a dormant moth</li>
            <li>Of many times his size.</li>
            <li>He showed not the least surprise.</li>
            <li>His business wasn't with such.</li>
            <li>He gave it scarcely a touch,</li>
            <li>And was off on his duty run.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Yet if he encountered one</li>
            <li>Of the hive's enquiry squad</li>
            <li>Whose work is to find out</li>
            <li>God And the nature of time and space,</li>
            <li>He would put him onto the case.</li>
            <li>Ants are a curious race;</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>One crossing with hurried tread</li>
            <li>The body of one of their dead</li>
            <li>Isn't given a moment's arrest-</li>
            <li>Seems not even impressed.</li>
            <li>But he no doubts report to any</li>
            <li>With whom he crosses antennae,</li>
            <li>And they no doubt report</li>
            <li>To the higher up at court.</li>

            <li>Then word goes forth in Formic:</li>
            <li>"Death's come to Jerry McCormic,</li>
            <li>Our selfless forager Jerry.</li>
            <li>Will the special Janizary</li>
            <li>Whose office it is to bury</li>
            <li>The dead of the commissary</li>
            <li>Go bring him home to his people.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Lay him in state on a sepal.</li>
            <li>Wrap him for shroud in a petal.</li>
            <li>Embalm him with ichor of nettle.</li>
            <li>This is the word of your Queen."</li>
            <li>And presently on the scene</li>
            <li>Appears a solemn mortician;</li>
            <li>And taking formal position</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>With feelers calmly atwiddle,</li>
            <li>Seizes the dead by the middle,</li>
            <li>And heaving him high in the air,</li>
            <li>Carries him out of there.</li>
            <li>No one stands round to stare.</li>
            <li>It is nobody else's affair.</li>
            <li>It couldn't be called ungentle.</li>
